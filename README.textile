h1. About 

This is experimental proxy server in node.js. It does two basic things:
* serves as a proxy between browser and your web server as well as CouchDB,
* WebSockets for fast master-slave replication with CouchDB.

h1. Why?

* browsers, for security reasons, don't allow cross-domain ajax request, required for full CouchDB support,
* optimized load and speed for master-to-many-slaves

h1. Demo

Run CouchDB server:

  $ couchdb
  Apache CouchDB 1.0.0 (LogLevel=info) is starting.
  Apache CouchDB has started. Time to relax.
  [info] [<0.33.0>] Apache CouchDB has started on http://127.0.0.1:5984/

Run your web server:

  $ cd ./html/
  $ thin -A file start
  >> Using file adapter
  >> Thin web server (v1.2.7 codename No Hup)
  >> Maximum connections set to 1024
  >> Listening on 0.0.0.0:3000, CTRL+C to stop

Run our proxy server (it may require root):

  $ node server.js
  25 Jul 21:03:34 - socket.io ready - accepting connections

Open browser which supports WebSockets and go to: http://127.0.0.1:8080/console.html
This is console. You can do basic CRUD request to your DB. For example select @PUT@ and enter: @/@. It will create new database "browsercouch" (which is default name. You can change it in @./server.js@ file).

Refresh page and open another browser window and go to the same console page. Then choose @POST@ and type @/ {"hello": "world"}@. This will save new document in database. Notice how fast this update appeared in the other browser window.

h1. Future

* Replace BrowserCouch's Ajax replications with WebSockets,
* pass specs,
* make similar console for comuniaction with BrowserCouch.
